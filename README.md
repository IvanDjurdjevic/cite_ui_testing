# cite_ui_testing
This project is based on testing the CITE web application [https://obuke.cite.edu.rs/] which enables learning programming languages remotely through corresponding video materials. It also serves as a practicing resource for the Selenium Test Framework. The tests are written in JavaScript and cover various aspects of testing, including elements, contact forms, alerts, frames, windows, and anything else available on the mentioned testing website.
